        Strong leader. Team player.

        <br>
        I thrive on problem-solving and guiding teams toward creative, efficient solutions that make a real impact.

        <h2>My Journey to Development</h2>
        <p>I never expected coding to change my life—until a friend’s older sister - in passing -  suggested that I start learning HTML.

        <p>   
            Initially, I was lost in what I wanted to do. I knew I was ambitious and capable of anything I applied myself to, but there lingered the question:
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
“What should I apply myself to?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Once I started to learn front-end development, I immediately felt that passion and knew that this is what I wanted pursue.
            <br>
            <br>
Since then, I have been relentless in my pursuit of learning and constantly hold myself to the highest standards, ensuring every project reflects both my dedication and love for the craft.
