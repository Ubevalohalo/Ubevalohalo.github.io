                <h3>Curious. Adaptable. Resilient.</h3>
                <p>
                    I’m a front-end developer who loves creating engaging digital experiences. I build responsive, accessible, and SEO-friendly websites that balance performance with great user experience. My work applies ADA best practices along with SEO strategies like site speed, content optimization, and structured design.
                    <br><br>Beyond development, I bring knowledge of online marketing, audience targeting, and performance metrics, giving me a strong foundation to design, build, and launch successful projects. I thrive in fast-paced settings, adapt quickly, and approach challenges with creativity and resilience. 
                    <br><br>At my core, I’m passionate about designing digital experiences that are not only functional but also beautiful, interactive, and captivating—interfaces that engage users, delight with aesthetics, and combine creativity with seamless usability.</p>

            <div id="top">
                <p>I never expected coding to change my life — until my friend’s older sister, sneaking past her mom and me in the kitchen for some snacks, casually suggested I try learning HTML.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="left">
                <im.g src="headshot1.jpeg">
            </div>
            <div id="right">
                <p>At the time, I was lost in what I wanted to do. I knew I was ambitious and capable of anything I applied myself to, but the question lingered:
                <br><br>
                “What should I apply myself to?”
                <br><br>
                Then, with nothing more than determination and excitement, I started to learn how to code.
               <br><br>
                Once I started exploring front-end development, I immediately felt a spark of passion and knew this was what I wanted to pursue. Since then, I’ve been relentless in learning and growth, holding myself to high standards so every project reflects both my dedication and love for the craft.
                <br><br> That offhand suggestion, offered in a split second before she dashed off with her snacks, ended up changing the projection of my life and journey in coding.

                Since then, I have been relentless in my pursuit of learning and constantly hold myself to the highest standards, ensuring every project reflects both my dedication and love for the craft.</p>
